                            <h1>Why should you know your personality?</h1>
                            <p>A personality test can provide us with a way to categorized different characteristics or traits that we might otherwise not be aware of.
<br>
                                Additionally, this categorization will help us learn how others might react to something in their environment.
                                <br>
                                These tests can be used for self-reflection and understanding, for job placement, and for learning how to better interact with others in a team or work group.</p>
                        <p>
                            By taking a personality test, one can often learn about his/herself and encourage self awareness.  For example, if a job involves presenting speeches and mingling with large crowds of people, but youâ€™ve always felt a little uncomfortable performing the job functions, knowing that you are naturally introverted can help you to better understand yourself.  You will realize that performing these social functions will drain you of your energy.  By making this realization, you will be better able to cope with your job and create happiness for yourself.  For example, you can learn that you might have a better evening if you spend some quiet time alone before the functions to gather your energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Personality tests and quizzes can also provide insight into how you react to other people. For example, certain personality types have a tendency to get along better, while other personality types often are prone to arguments and clashes of style and opinion.</p>
                    <p>The goal of knowing about personality type is to understand and appreciate differences between people. As all types are equal, there is no best type.</p>
